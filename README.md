# Mujoco Physics Sandbox

This repository serves as a sandbox for testing Mujoco physics simulator functionality for robotics. The main purpose of this project is to provide a platform for experimenting with various robotics simulations using the Mujoco physics engine.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Mujoco 2.0 or higher
- A valid Mujoco license

## Setup and Installation

### Setting up a Python virtual environment

To set up a Python virtual environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the `virtualenv` package if you haven't already:

```
pip install virtualenv
```

2. Navigate to the project directory and create a new virtual environment:

```
cd mujoco_physics_sandbox
virtualenv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

  ```
